## Overview

In the AngryFlappyBird game, the player must choose the difficulty level first, then click "Start" to start the game and move the angry flappy bird in a scrolling scene. In the scene, a set of two pipes of a random height show up after every fixed amount of time, some upward-facing pipes have collectible eggs on top of them, while some downward-facing pipes have pig thieves dropping down to steal the eggs. If the bird hits the golden egg, it will immediately get into snooze time(pilot mode). The game's goal is for the angry flappy bird to move through the pipes without colliding while collecting as many eggs as possible along the way to prevent the pigs from stealing the eggs. To enhance the gaming experience, we also integrated background music and sound effects.
