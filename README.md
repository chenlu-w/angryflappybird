## Overview

In the AngryFlappyBird game, the player need to choice the difficulty level first, then click on the button "Start" to start the game and move the angry flappy bird in a scrolling scene. In the scene, a set of two pipes of a random height show up after every fixed amount of time, some upward facing pipes have collectable eggs on top of them, while some downward facing pipes have pig thieves dropping down to steal the eggs. If the bird hit the golden egg, it will immediate get into snooze time(pilot mode). The goal of the game is for the angry flappy bird to move through the pipes without collision while collecting as many eggs as possible along the way to prevent the pigs from stealing the eggs. To enhance the gaming experience, we also integrated background music and sound effects.
